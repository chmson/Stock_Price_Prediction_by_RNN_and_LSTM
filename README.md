# Stock_Price_Prediction_by_RNN_and_LSTM

Implemented a machine learning project to predict stock prices utilizing recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Leveraged historical data from Tesla Inc. obtained through a CSV file to train and evaluate the models.

Achieved significant accuracy of LSTM is 87% and accuracy of RNN is 89%.
